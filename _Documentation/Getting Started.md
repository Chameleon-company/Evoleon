# Getting Started

# Usage
Download the expo go app from the play / apple store. Scan the QR code shown in the terminal after running 'npx expo start' and you will be able to view the app. At the moment, there is a problem with the web view for development. It's recommended to just use your phone for the moment.

The problem is with webpack, webpack is used to translate packages from react native which runs on mobile devices to a react web framework.

If you can't use your mobile phone for any sort of development, another option is to temporarily comment out the MapView container within ./screens/DatabaseScreen.tsx.

If you want to fix the web view issue, it's probably within the versions of react-native, react-native-web, react-native-maps and react-native-web-maps used. Have a look within webpack.config.js and uncomment the alias lines.
