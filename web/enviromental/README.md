## Enviromental Variable

## Introduction

The enviromental variable .env files is used to connect to the database. The .env file is not included in the repository for security reasons. The .env file should be placed in the enviromental folder. The .env file should contain the following information:

```
  apiKey: 'API Key',
  authDomain: 'Web domain name',
  projectId: 'Name of the project',
  storageBucket: 'Storage bucket name',
  messagingSenderId: 'Integer for messaging sender ID',
  appId: 'Application ID',
  measurementId: 'Measurement ID',
  databaseURL: 'URL for the database',
```

The security team will have acess to the enviromental variable file. This needs to be added to the repo locally, please contact the security team for the .env file or the team lead.
