# About the Evoleon App (react native)
<!-- Describe your project in brief -->
An android application to find the nearest charging point for electric cars with the help of navigation. This source code is useful for building a cross-platform mobile app with hamburger-menu-style navigation built in.This builds on top of the drawer-style navigation included in React Navigation by adding a hamburger menu button to the top-left of the screen which can open and close the drawer.
With gesture-navigation being the standard for Android 10+, the need for a clickable way to open and close app drawers has resurfaced.
This template provides that.

**Uses:** Expo, React Native, React Navigation, Typescript. 

Sets up for you: evoleon app menu, drawer navigation, tests (with jest), hooks, deep linking, custom font support, splash screen, dark/light mode support.

# Usage
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Download the expo go app from the play / apple store. Scan the QR code shown in the terminal after running 'npm run start' and you will be able to view the app. At the moment, there is a problem with the web view for development. It's recommended to just use your phone for the moment.

The problem is with webpack, webpack is used to translate packages from react native which runs on mobile devices to a react web framework.

If you can't use your mobile phone for any sort of development, another option is to temporarily comment out the MapView container within ./screens/DatabaseScreen.tsx.

If you want to fix the web view issue, it's probably within the versions of react-native, react-native-web, react-native-maps and react-native-web-maps used. Have a look within webpack.config.js and uncomment the alias lines.
