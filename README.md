<!-- Describe your project in brief -->

An android application to find the nearest charging point for electric cars with the help of navigation. This source code is useful for building a cross-platform mobile app with hamburger-menu-style navigation built in.This builds on top of the drawer-style navigation included in React Navigation by adding a hamburger menu button to the top-left of the screen which can open and close the drawer.
With gesture-navigation being the standard for Android 10+, the need for a clickable way to open and close app drawers has resurfaced.
This template provides that.

Uses: Expo v39, React Native 0.63, React Navigation 5.0, Typescript

Sets up for you: evoleon app menu, drawer navigation, tests (with jest), hooks, deep linking, custom font support, splash screen, dark/light mode support
